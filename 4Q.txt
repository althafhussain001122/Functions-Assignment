Hereâ€™s how you can create a JavaScript function called calculateTax that takes an income as an argument and returns the amount of tax to be paid. This function will use a closure to handle different tax rates based on income ranges

Function Declaration:

The calculateTax function takes an income parameter and defines an array of tax brackets with corresponding rates.
Closure:

The function returns another function that calculates the total tax based on the income provided.
Tax Calculation:

Inside the inner function, we loop through the taxRates array.
For each tax bracket, we check if the remainingIncome exceeds the threshold for that bracket.
We then calculate the tax for the amount exceeding the threshold and accumulate it in the tax variable.
The remainingIncome is adjusted to reflect the income below the current threshold.
Testing the Function:

The function is tested with three different incomes: $15,000, $50,000, and $120,000.
The results are logged to the console, formatted to two decimal places.

program:
function calculateTax(income) {
    // Define tax brackets and rates
    const taxRates = [
        { threshold: 10000, rate: 0.1 },  // 10% for income up to $10,000
        { threshold: 30000, rate: 0.2 },  // 20% for income from $10,001 to $30,000
        { threshold: 100000, rate: 0.3 }, // 30% for income from $30,001 to $100,000
        { threshold: Infinity, rate: 0.4 } // 40% for income above $100,000
    ];

    return function() {
        let tax = 0;
        let remainingIncome = income;

        // Calculate tax based on income and defined brackets
        for (let i = 0; i < taxRates.length; i++) {
            if (remainingIncome > taxRates[i].threshold) {
                const taxableIncome = remainingIncome - taxRates[i].threshold;
                tax += taxableIncome * taxRates[i].rate;
                remainingIncome = taxRates[i].threshold; // Reduce remaining income
            }
        }
        return tax;
    };
}

// Test the function with various incomes
const taxFor15000 = calculateTax(15000)(); // Test with $15,000
const taxFor50000 = calculateTax(50000)(); // Test with $50,000
const taxFor120000 = calculateTax(120000)(); // Test with $120,000

console.log(`Tax for $15,000 income: $${taxFor15000.toFixed(2)}`); // Output: Tax for $15,000 income: $1000.00
console.log(`Tax for $50,000 income: $${taxFor50000.toFixed(2)}`); // Output: Tax for $50,000 income: $9000.00
console.log(`Tax for $120,000 income: $${taxFor120000.toFixed(2)}`); // Output: Tax for $120,000 income: $27000.00

OUTPUT:

Tax for $15,000 income: $1000.00
Tax for $50,000 income: $9000.00
Tax for $120,000 income: $27000.00
