Here's how you can create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that calculates the square of a number and immediately displays the result.
IIFE Declaration:

The function is defined using the syntax (function(num) {...}), which means it will be executed immediately after its definition.
This function takes a single parameter num.
Calculating the Square:

Inside the function, the square of num is calculated by multiplying it by itself (const result = num * num;).
Displaying the Result:

The result is printed to the console using console.log.
Passing an Argument:

The IIFE is immediately invoked with the argument 8, so it calculates the square of 8 and displays it.

PROGRAM:

// IIFE to calculate and display the square of a number
(function(num) {
    const result = num * num; // Calculate the square
    console.log(`The square of ${num} is:`, result); // Display the result
})(8); // Pass the number 8 as an argument

output:

The square of 8 is: 64
