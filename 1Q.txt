Here’s how you can create an arrow function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. I'll also demonstrate how to use this function to calculate and display the square of a given number.

Here’s how you can create an arrow function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. I'll also demonstrate how to use this function to calculate and display the square of a given number.

JavaScript Code:
javascript
Copy code
// Arrow function to calculate the square of a number
const square = (num) => num * num;

// Test the arrow function with a given number
const number = 5;
const result = square(number);

// Display the result
console.log(`The square of ${number} is:`, result); // Output: The square of 5 is: 25
Explanation:
Arrow Function Declaration:

The function square is defined using the arrow function syntax const square = (num) => num * num;.
It takes a single parameter num and returns the result of multiplying num by itself, effectively calculating the square.
Function Call:

We declare a variable number and assign it the value 5.
We then call the square function with number as an argument and store the result in the variable result.
Displaying the Result:

Finally, we use console.log to print the square of the number to the console in a formatted string.

program:

// Arrow function to calculate the square of a number
const square = (num) => num * num;

// Test the arrow function with a given number
const number = 5;
const result = square(number);

// Display the result
console.log(`The square of ${number} is:`, result); // Output: The square of 5 is: 25

output:
The square of 5 is: 25
